For question 1, we are utilizing Neville's method in Python to find the 2nd degree interploting value for f(3.7) based on the data given. For question 2, we use Newton's forward method in Python to compute the polynomial approximations for degrees 1, 2, and 3 using the provided data. Using the answers from question 2, we solve question 3 by approximating f(7.3) in python. For question 4, we use the divided difference method to print out the Hermite polynomial approximation matrix using the provided table. Lastly, for question 5, we use the cubic spline interpolation mathod to solve matrix A, vector b, and vector x based on the given table. 
To run the code, you just hit run and debug (since this is on github) and each expected result should be properly computed with the correct spacing.
